Every year, more than 140 million bookings are made on the internet, with many hotel reservations processed through top-visited travel websites like Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, etc. According to Google data, hotels are typically booked in advance of 12 weeks.

This dataset comprises 31 features detailing booking information, including Average Daily Rate, Arrival Time, Room Type, Special Requests, etc., spanning the years 2015 to 2017.

This project aims to delve into the booking information through exploratory data analysis, and visualization of the most important features and their distribution properties. 

The conclusions are described in graphs in the body of the project.
